The sun hangs low, casting long shadows over the cracked earth. SAM, gaunt and weary, limps across the barren terrain. RINA, clutching a worn medical bag, follows closely behind.*

SAM (determined) We have to keep moving, Rina. The map said there’s water ahead.

RINA (fighting fatigue) We’ve been walking for days, Sam. What if it’s just another mirage?

A rustling sound halts their conversation. THEO emerges from behind a crumbling wall, his face partially hidden by a scarf.

THEO (softly) You’re not alone out here.

Sam instinctively raises a makeshift spear, eyes narrowing at the newcomer.

SAM (warily) Who are you?

THEO (calmly) A friend. Or a foe. Depends on what you’re looking for.

INT. RUINED SHELTER - DUSK

The trio huddles around a small fire inside a dilapidated building. Shadows flicker across their faces.

RINA (sighing) I used to treat people… before the virus wiped out everything.

THEO (quietly) The world needs healers now more than ever.

SAM (impatiently) Enough talk. Do you know where the water is or not?

Theo reaches into his coat, pulling out a map, edges frayed and yellowed.

THEO (cryptically) I know where it might be. But it’s guarded by those who don’t welcome strangers.

EXT. FORSAKEN OUTPOST - NIGHT

Under a canopy of stars, the group approaches a decrepit outpost. A faint glimmer of water reflects in the moonlight beyond.

SAM (whispering) There it is.

RINA (hopeful) We can finally rest.

Suddenly, the sound of shifting debris echoes. Figures emerge from the shadows, eyes hollow and unblinking.

THEO (shouting) They’re here!

Panic erupts as they scramble for safety, the figures advancing silently.

RINA (desperate) Sam, this way!

INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE - NIGHT

The passage is narrow and suffocating. Sam and Rina stumble forward, Theo trailing behind, his footsteps growing distant.

SAM (panting) We need to block the entrance.

Rina nods, helping to shove debris into the opening. Silence descends once more.

THEO (from the shadows) You did well. But remember, the wasteland holds no promises.

Theo steps into the dim light, his expression unreadable. He throws a small canteen to Sam, its contents sloshing faintly.

THEO (somberly) The last echoes of what was. Use it wisely.

Theo turns away, disappearing into the darkness. Sam and Rina, clutching the canteen, exchange a glance filled with both hope and dread.
