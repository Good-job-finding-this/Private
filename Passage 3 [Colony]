INT. SCRAP TOWN CLINIC - NIGHT

Paul sits beside Sydney, her hand in his, as she drifts into a fitful sleep. The door creaks open, and the DOCTOR enters quietly.

DOCTOR
Paul, we need to talk.

Paul stands, following the doctor to a corner of the room.

PAUL
(whispering)
What is it?

DOCTOR
We need to ensure you’re not carrying the Colony virus. It’s how we protect the town. The infected connect to a hive mind, and if you're compromised...

Paul nods, understanding the gravity of the situation.

PAUL
What do I need to do?

INT. SCRAP TOWN MEDICAL FACILITY - NIGHT

Paul sits in a small examination room. A NURSE prepares a series of tests, her expression serious but kind.

NURSE
Try to relax. This will only take a few minutes.

She begins the tests, drawing blood and checking for signs of infection. Paul remains still, his mind racing with possibilities.

PAUL
(quietly)
What if I’m infected?

NURSE
(reassuring)
We’ll cross that bridge if we come to it. But let's hope for the best.

INT. SCRAP TOWN CLINIC - NIGHT

Paul returns to Sydney's side, watching her sleep. The wait feels eternal, each second stretching into an eternity.

Finally, the doctor enters, holding a clipboard.

DOCTOR
Paul, we have the results.

Paul stands, his heart pounding in his chest.

PAUL
And?

DOCTOR
(relieved)
You’re clear. No signs of the Colony virus. You're safe.

Paul exhales deeply, relief and exhaustion washing over him.

PAUL
Thank you. I don’t know what we would have done...

DOCTOR
(seriously)
Stay vigilant. There’s no cure yet, and the virus is unpredictable. But you and Sydney are welcome here. We look after our own.

EXT. SCRAP TOWN - DAY

The sun rises over the scrap town, casting a warm glow over the makeshift buildings. Paul and Sydney sit together outside, Sydney's leg bandaged but healing.

SYDNEY
(softly)
We have a chance, Paul. A real chance.

Paul nods, the weight of their journey still heavy but manageable.
