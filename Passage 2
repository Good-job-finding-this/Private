EXT. BASE OF THE HILL - DAY

Paul and Sydney begin their trek across the barren desert, the scrap town a distant silhouette against the horizon. The sun beats down mercilessly, sapping their energy with each step.

SYDNEY
(weakly)
Paul... I don't know if I can make it.

Paul looks at her, concern etched on his face. The infection has spread, her skin pale and feverish.

PAUL
(urgently)
Just a little further, Syd. We're almost there.

EXT. DESERT WASTELAND - DAY

As they continue, Sydney's steps falter. Her breathing becomes labored, and she collapses into the sand.

PAUL
(panicked)
Syd! No, no, no... stay with me!

He kneels beside her, cradling her head. Her eyes flutter open, but she is barely conscious.

SYDNEY
(whispering)
Paul... it hurts...

Paul lifts her, carrying her as best as he can toward the town, his determination unwavering.

EXT. SCRAP TOWN ENTRANCE - DAY

They reach the outskirts of the scrap town, where makeshift houses cobbled together from metal and wood stand resilient against the wasteland.

A GUARD spots them, raising an alarm. Several townspeople rush to assist, their faces wary but sympathetic.

GUARD
Who are you? What do you want?

PAUL
(desperate)
Please, she’s sick. She needs help... anything you can do.

The guard assesses the situation, nodding to the others.

GUARD
Bring them in. Quickly.

INT. SCRAP TOWN CLINIC - DAY

In a small, cluttered clinic, a DOCTOR examines Sydney. Paul stands nearby, anxiety etched in every line of his face.

DOCTOR
(grimly)
The infection’s advanced. It's a necrotic strain, eating away at her leg. We need to act fast.

PAUL
(pleading)
What can we do?

DOCTOR
The only chance is to amputate. It doesn't spread through blood, but if it reaches her core... she won’t survive.

Paul looks at Sydney, who nods weakly, tears in her eyes.

SYDNEY
(softly)
Do it, Paul. I trust you.

EXT. SCRAP TOWN - NIGHT

As the town settles into a tense quiet, Paul waits outside the clinic, the weight of the decision heavy on his shoulders.

The door opens, and the doctor steps out, wiping his hands.

DOCTOR
(softly)
She's stable. We managed to stop the infection. She'll need time to heal.

Paul exhales, relief flooding through him.

PAUL
Thank you... thank you so much.

INT. SCRAP TOWN CLINIC - NIGHT

Paul enters the clinic, finding Sydney resting, her leg bandaged and missing below the knee. He takes her hand, squeezing it gently.

SYDNEY
(hoarsely)
We made it, Paul...

PAUL
(smiling)
Yeah, we did. You're going to be okay, Syd. We're going to be okay.
